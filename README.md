# cipherCode
A simple javascript cipher code

Since we are dealing with encryption and decryption and not hashing which is a one way function, hash functions will not work for this solution. Since i need a function that i can use to encode text (cipher) and and get back the text in plain form again i choose to use the ROT13 ("rotate by 13 places", sometimes hyphenated ROT-13)  

ROT13 is a simple letter substitution cipher that replaces a letter with the 13th letter after it in the alphabet. ROT13 is a special case of the Caesar cipher which was developed in ancient Rome.

Because there are 26 letters (2Ã—13) in the basic Latin alphabet, ROT13 is its own inverse; that is, to undo ROT13, the same algorithm is applied, so the same action can be used for encoding and decoding.
